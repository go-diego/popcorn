# Frontend Engineering Take-Home Exercise: Movie Library Application

The goal of this exercise is to implement a simple movie library application using the latest version of React and associated modern tools and libraries. Our expectation is that this will take a Senior Engineer 2-4 hours to complete, but we know you may be busy so take as much time as you need. Note that if you already have a recent project that generally fits the outline of this excercise, feel free to submit that instead. Thank you!

## Exercise Background

The task is to create a simple movie library application. The app should fetch movie data from an API (such as [The Movie Database (TMDB) API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)) and allow the user to perform the following actions:

- View a list of movies
- Search for a movie by its title
- Click on a movie to view more detailed information about it
- Maintain a personal favorite movie list

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to view a list of popular movies when I open the app.
- As a user, I want to search for a movie by its title.
- As a user, I want to click on a movie from the search result or the list of popular movies and view more detailed information about the movie (like the title, description, release date, rating, and poster).
- As a user, I want to add or remove movies from my personal favorite movie list.

## Requirements

- Implement the application using React.
- The application should be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile.
- Implement error handling and loading states.
- All code and comments should be written in English.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Project structure and organization
- React best practices and idiomatic usage of hooks, context API, or other React features
- Code readability and maintainability
- Understanding of the React ecosystem
- State management
- Responsive design
- Error handling
- Performance optimizations

## Submission

Please submit a link to the GitHub repository containing your solution, as well as instructions for running the application locally. The project should include a README with an overview of your project, technical choices, and any notes on areas you would improve given more time.

Remember, this exercise is not just about getting the functionality to work. We want to see how you approach problem-solving, your thought process, and your understanding of React and modern frontend engineering principles. Please commit early and often, with clear and concise commit messages.

## Note

If you don't want to use TMDB API for any reason, you can use any other movie API or create a mock API using json-server or similar. The idea here is not about the data, but how you structure your project, your code, your state management, etc. Happy coding!
